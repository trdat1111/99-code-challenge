## Problems Overview

### Problem 1: Sum to N (Three Approaches)

**File**: `src/problem1/problem1.js`

Implements the sum from 1 to N using three different approaches:

1. **Iterative Solution (Loop)**

    - Time Complexity: O(n)
    - Space Complexity: O(1)

2. **Mathematical Formula**

    - Time Complexity: O(1)
    - Space Complexity: O(1)

3. **Recursive Solution**
    - Time Complexity: O(n)
    - Space Complexity: O(n)

**Key Features**:

-   Input validation for edge cases
-   Performance comparison testing
-   Comprehensive error handling

### Problem 2: Crypto Token Swap Application

**Directory**: `src/problem2/`

A responsive React TypeScript application for swapping cryptocurrency tokens.

**Key Features**:

-   **Mobile-First Responsive Design**: Supports 320px+ viewports
-   **Enhanced UI**: Fixed dropdown styling with custom SVG arrows
-   **Real-Time Validation**: Form validation with clear error messages
-   **Dynamic Exchange Rates**: Mock API with realistic calculations
-   **Loading States**: Smooth UX with proper loading indicators
-   **TypeScript Excellence**: Comprehensive interfaces and type safety

**Technical Stack**:

-   React 19 with TypeScript
